# google-homepage

    In this project I was called to bring out a basic google search homepage which I indeed did. 
    It's not perfectly looking but it shows the essential parts. Behind this project there is a html
     file (google.html) to define the structure of the page and indeed the presence of css file(google-style.css)
     to give a good looking style to the page. There is still a little failure on "Google Search" & "I'm feeling lucky"
     buttons but it will be fixed very soon so stay tune to my activity. 

    Thanks!!!
